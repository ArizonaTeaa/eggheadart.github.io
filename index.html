<h3 style="font-family:'Courier New'">Why are trees so important?</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:'Courier New'">humans cut down approximately 15 billion trees a year and re-plant about 5 billion. That's a loss of 10 billion trees every year, and a rate that would mean the loss of all trees within the next 300 years. That number doesn't even include the trees that die naturally.It also estimates that 46% of the world's trees have been cleared over the past 12,000 years. After calculating that number from the total amount of trees on the planet, humans have chopped down about 13984000000 trees. </h4>

<h3 style="font-family:'Courier New'">Why is it such a big problem?</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:'Courier New'"> The lumber industry has grown due to an increase in demand from construction and home remodeling, both of which use lumber heavily. Industry revenue has grown at an annualized rate of $135.4 billion over the span of five years.And since 2020, the softwood industry has supported more than 775,000 jobs. Our economy relies heavily on lumber to function. If the lumber economy crashed, the world would be in a state of crisis.</h3>
